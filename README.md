### Description
This project leverages the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock closing prices using Python. The LSTM architecture excels in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series prediction tasks like stock price forecasting.

### Dependencies:
1. Python
2. TensorFlow or Keras for LSTM implementation
3. Pandas for data manipulation
4. Matplotlib or Plotly for visualization
5. Scikit-learn for model evaluation and metrics
